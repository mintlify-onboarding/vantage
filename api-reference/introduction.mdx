With the API, you can perform the following actions:

- Create a folder structure that matches your organizational structure
- Create any reports with needed filters inside this structure

## Usage

Vantage's [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) API has resource-oriented URLs, returns [JSON-encoded](https://www.json.org/) responses, and leverages [standard HTTP response codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).

## Authentication and Access Tokens

The API is free to use but requires a token. See [Authentication](/reference/authentication) for instructions on creating your API token.
