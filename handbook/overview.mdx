title: Cloud Cost Handbook
sidebarTitle: Overview
---

The Cloud Cost Handbook is a free, open-source, community-supported set of guides meant to help explain the complex pricing of public cloud infrastructure and service providers in easy-to-understand terms. This guide is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/vantage-sh/handbook) and is open to anyone to contribute their knowledge to the community. [Vantage](https://www.vantage.sh/) employees will maintain hosting the guide for everyone and ensure that content is relevant and adheres to style guides.

## Structure

This handbook is separated into two different sections as explained below:

### General Concepts

These are general concepts that don't necessarily map directly to a particular service.

### Provider Services

Provider services are meant to be the source of truth for explaining not only the pricing mechanics of the service but also to explain potentially nuanced concepts related to costs for that service. The focus of these pages is meant to be on the _pricing_ of these services and not related to the actual management or orchestration of the service itself.

<Note>
  **A Note About Currency** Any listed prices are provided in US Dollars (USD).
  This is also the [default
  currency](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/supported-aws-currencies) AWS
  uses for billing.
